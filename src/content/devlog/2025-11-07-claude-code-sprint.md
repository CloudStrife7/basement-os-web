Started my first session with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) - this is a game changer. Instead of copying code snippets back and forth, Claude can directly read my project files, write code, and even help with git commits.

Spent the session adding comprehensive XML docstrings to all major scripts. The AchievementTracker alone went from zero documentation to fully annotated with parameter descriptions and usage examples.

Also started setting up project automation - automatic UdonSharp validation before commits, organized GitHub issues with story points, and established milestones. Treating Claude like a jr developer is really showing how much leadership and project management coordination I have in this area.
