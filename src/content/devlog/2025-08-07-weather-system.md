Integrated real-time weather from Fond du Lac, WI using a GitHub Pages JSON endpoint. The terminal displays current conditions and when it's actually raining outside, the basement windows show rain effects.

Rain shader source: [PLACEHOLDER - Please specify the rain shader source (Unity Asset Store, GitHub repo, custom made, etc.)]
