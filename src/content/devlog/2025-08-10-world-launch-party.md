Hosted a private launch event for our founding members before opening Lower Level 2.0 to the public. Watching the achievement notifications pop as people joined was incredibly satisfying - exactly the vibe I was going for.

Thank you to our founding members for donating to make Lower Level 2 a virtual reality: Lexx, Onawarren, and M0J170.

Still a few bugs to work through, but the core systems are running - notifications, persistence, the DOS terminal.
