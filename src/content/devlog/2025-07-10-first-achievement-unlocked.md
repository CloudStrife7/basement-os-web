First achievement notification popped in-world today! "First Time Visitor" - the notification banner slides in from the right with that Xbox 360 bloop sound. Feels exactly like it did on the 360.

The FIFO queue, animation timing, and sound cues all working together. This is the moment I've been building toward since starting this project.
