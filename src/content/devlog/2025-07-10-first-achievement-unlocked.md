I received the Lower Level from our developer millerpc_ and the quality is astonishing, like stepping back in time. I wanted to add something special so I started working on my first AI coding idea, welcome pop ups, and I accomplished that in 4 hours! It went so well, I decided to keep building with AI and make achievements!

First achievement notification popped in-world today! "First Time Visitor" - the notification banner fades in with a satisfying notification chime. Feels exactly like it did on the 360.

This was my first time working with layers in Unity, animation timing, and sound cues all working together. I had hoped to create something special to surprise my friends for the release, and this is the moment I've been building toward since starting this project. Working with Claude web to code this in UdonSharp, which I'd never used before, actually worked!
