Designed custom icons for the Founders and Supporters achievements using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/). I highly recommend it as a free Photoshop alternative. Referenced actual Xbox 360 achievement art to match that 2000s gaming aesthetic.

Achievement icons were unique to the Xbox 360 dashboard, so I made custom ones in the style of the originals for founding members and supporters.

<div class="icon-gallery">
  <img src="/images/devlog/achievement-icons/pwnerer.png" alt="Pwnerer achievement icon" />
  <img src="/images/devlog/achievement-icons/trek.png" alt="Trek achievement icon" />
  <img src="/images/devlog/achievement-icons/trooper.png" alt="Trooper achievement icon" />
  <img src="/images/devlog/achievement-icons/bobomb.png" alt="Bob-omb achievement icon" />
</div>
