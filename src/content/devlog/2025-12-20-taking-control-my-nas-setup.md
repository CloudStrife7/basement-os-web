I’m migrating my data off cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox, Google Photos) to local storage.

**The Foundation:**

- Synology DS224+ NAS
- 2×8TB drives in RAID 1 (mirrored for redundancy)
- 8GB RAM
- Running Immich for our 21-year, 85K+ photo library

Cloud storage costs $10-20/month indefinitely. A NAS is a one-time hardware cost with no monthly fees, and my data stays completely under my control—no third-party access, processing, or terms-of-service changes.

Google has a habit of changing their website interfaces (from Picasa, to Google Photos and  Google Music to YouTube Music) and they always seem to be lacking features to previous interface had.

Open source software Immich replicates Google Photos functionality (facial recognition, search, automatic backups) on my own hardware. I keep the convenience, lose the ongoing costs and privacy trade-offs.

Used googles Takeout service and then Immich-go for the import process.  When I wake up I will have a new photo library to enjoy.
