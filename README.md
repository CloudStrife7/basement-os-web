**An AI workflow learning portfolio documenting the development of Basement OS - a 2000s basement gaming VRChat experience with a fully functional DOS terminal interface.**

## 🎯 What This Project Is About

This isn't just a VRChat world showcase - **it's a learning portfolio and teaching tool** that demonstrates advanced AI-assisted development workflows.

I'm Zach, and I'm using this project to:
- **Learn AI-assisted development** through building something real
- **Document what works (and what doesn't)** as a teaching resource
- **Showcase advanced AI orchestration techniques** for portfolio purposes
- **Transition from leading AI developers to leading real teams** by building transferable skills

## 🤖 The AI Methodology

### Core Workflow: Closed-Loop Agent System

The breakthrough came from eliminating manual intervention in the development loop:

**Traditional AI workflow:**
```
AI writes code → Human tests in Unity → Human reports errors → AI fixes → Repeat
```

**My closed-loop system:**
```
AI writes code → Auto-compile → Auto-test → AI reads errors → AI fixes → Repeat
(Zero human intervention until it works)
```

### Key Techniques

#### 1. **Parallelized Multi-Agent Orchestration**
- Running 9+ specialized agents simultaneously
- Each agent has custom `agent.md` persona files with injected context
- Separation of concerns prevents cognitive overload
- Horizontal scaling: volume without sacrificing architecture

#### 2. **Unity MCP Integration**
The linchpin that makes autonomous testing possible:
- AI triggers compilation directly in Unity
- Enters Play mode and reads console logs
- Attaches components to GameObjects programmatically
- True CI/CD for game engines

#### 3. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**
I'm not replaced by AI - I'm orchestrating it:
- Supervising parallel agents
- Correcting drift in real-time
- Making architectural decisions
- Quality control through continuous validation

#### 4. **Context Injection & Drift Mitigation**
- Pre-loading agents with strict documentation before coding
- Real-time interruption when agents hallucinate
- Each agent gets specialized expertise via persona files

### The Result

**From "AI-assisted developer" to "AI workflow architect"**

I'm not just using tools - I'm building the automation that makes tools useful. The agent swarm builds the car fast (volume). The automation pipeline ensures it doesn't explode when you turn the key (quality assurance).

## 🏗️ The Project: Basement OS

**Lower Level 2.0** - An authentic 2000s basement gaming VRChat experience featuring:

- **Basement OS**: Fully functional DOS-style terminal with working commands
- **Xbox 360 Achievement System**: Persistent achievements with nostalgic notifications
- **Real-time Weather**: Live weather integration via API
- **Retro Aesthetic**: CRT monitors, wood paneling, and 2000s gaming memorabilia

What started as a simple hangout space evolved into a virtual homelab for AI experimentation.

## 📝 About the Content

This devlog documents my learning journey with AI-assisted workflows. All content is generated using AI tools with active human oversight, review, and approval. I'm the architect and decision-maker - AI is my development team.

**The goal is transparency**: I want to show *how* AI-assisted development works, not just the results.
