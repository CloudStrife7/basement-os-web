Instead of picking issues randomly or by gut feeling, what if AI could act as a SCRUM master and pre-spec *everything*?\r\n\r\n### The Challenge\r\n\r\nWith 58 open issues across features, bugs, concepts, and epics, there was no clear way to know:\r\n- Which issues Claude Code could handle autonomously\r\n- Which had the highest \"basement nostalgia\" impact\r\n- How to balance effort vs. payoff\r\n\r\nI needed a system that would lay out work explicitly, so I could return and start building immediately.\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\nI created **Basement Build Priority (BBP)**—a scoring formula:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBBP = (Agentic_Feasibility × Nostalgia_Score) / Story_Points\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Metric | Range | Purpose |\r\n|--------|-------|---------|\r\n| Agentic Feasibility | 0-100% | Can Claude + Unity MCP complete this? |\r\n| Nostalgia Score | 1-10 | Does it make the basement feel alive? |\r\n| Story Points | 1-21 | Fibonacci effort scale |\r\n\r\nClaude analyzed all 58 issues, assigned scores, and applied a **\"Good Agentic Build\"** label to 36 issues with ≥70% feasibility. The result: a prioritized backlog where high-BBP items are high-automation, high-nostalgia, low-effort wins.\r\n\r\n### Why It Matters\r\n\r\nThis shifts Claude from \"assistant\" to \"project manager.\" Instead of asking \"what should I work on?\", the backlog is pre-scored and ready. If the Agentic + MCP combo continues to prove itself (like it did with music.exe), it will take over a meaningful portion of the workload—in theory I could assign Claude to work on agentic issues while I focus on the non-agentic ones. My bandwidth is now \"monitoring and review\" rather than code, integrate, test, verify.\r\n\r\n### The Paradigm Shift\r\n\r\nThis represents the third evolution in my AI journey:\r\n\r\n| Phase | Mindset | Limiting Factor |\r\n|-------|---------|-----------------|\r\n| **Before AI** | \"What *can* I build?\" | Skill |\r\n| **With AI** | \"What *should* I build?\" | Imagination |\r\n| **Agentic AI** | \"What will Claude build while I review?\" | Bandwidth |\r\n\r\n**Key Insight:** Pre-scoring issues with AI as SCRUM master (and reviewing its accuracy) means when I dedicate time to build, I can put Claude to work on low-impact agentic issues while I tackle the highest-impact ones—and have a head start. It could in theory complete an issue 60% of the way if it has 60% agentic feasibility, and I only have to finish the last 40% instead of 100%.","src/content/devlog/2025-12-29-introducing-bbp-ai-issue-prioritization.md","87aee21c1079da2d",{"html":432,"metadata":433},"\u003Cp>After successfully having Claude Code autonomously implement \u003Ccode>music.exe\u003C/code>—a Basement OS terminal app that integrates with ProTV 3.x for real-time playlist browsing and playback control—I wanted to scale that approach.
