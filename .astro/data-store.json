That's too much overhead for a system meant to *save* time.\r\n\r\n### The Solution: 90% Simplification\r\nI re-evaluated the requirements against the core mission: **chronicling the AI skill journey**. I realized that the developer (me) always knows *what* matters—I just need help structuring it.\r\n\r\n**The New \"Lite\" Workflow:**\r\n1. **One Master Template:** No more auto-classification logic. I pick the type ([Milestone], [TIL], [Meta]).\r\n2. **Dialogue > Algorithms:** Instead of predicting importance, the system will just ask me: *\"What's your one-liner takeaway?\"* and *\"Why does this matter?\"*.\r\n3. **AI Synthesis:** The agent takes my raw reflection and structures it into the narrative format.\r\n\r\n### Why It Matters\r\nThis reduces the build time from **two weeks** to **~1 day**. \r\n\r\nIt shifts the focus from building complex logic to **capturing authentic learning moments**. By replacing \"AI guessing\" with \"Human reflection,\" the devlogs will be more insightful and personal, while still leveraging AI for the heavy lifting of formatting and publishing.\r\n\r\n**Key Insight:** Automation shouldn't replace the *thinking*—it should remove the friction of *documenting* that thinking.","src/content/devlog/2025-12-11-devlog-system-simplification.md","6218580aaecd2533",{"html":335,"metadata":336},"\u003Ch3 id=\"the-problem-over-engineering-the-documentation\">The Problem: Over-Engineering the Documentation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>I realized that my initial plan for the Automated Devlog System was becoming a project in itself.
