# Reddit Post Draft - ClaudeAI Subreddit

**Title:** 25 years in IT, finally found my calling: 18,000 lines of VR code in 4 months with AI. Here's what actually worked.

---

After 25+ years in IT—desktop support, infrastructure, never quite finding "my thing"—I finally did.

## The Backstory

My basement was always the hangout spot growing up. I spent 2 years recreating my childhood home in VRChat to surprise my friends. But they kept asking for a more detailed version. So I commissioned an artist to rebuild my 2000s basement in full detail.

It was complete. But something was missing. Then it hit me—what if it had Xbox 360-style achievement notifications? That feeling of the pop-up and the sound. That's the nostalgia I wanted.

## The Problem

I had zero UdonSharp experience. It's VRChat's programming language—a constrained C# subset with no generics, no try/catch, strict limits. I'd implemented other creators' projects, but never built my own.

## The Turning Point

Week 1: Copy-pasting from Claude into Unity, spending 80% of the session re-explaining context. Hit a wall at 500 lines.

Then something clicked. I stopped treating it like a chatbot and started treating it like a junior dev that needs good specs. I created "Project Knowledge" files. Claude started updating its own documentation. I broke the system into 8 modules to bypass context limits.

4 hours later, I had a working Xbox 360 notification system—full animations, sound, the whole thing. I'd budgeted 4 weeks.

## 4 months later:
- 18,000+ lines across 47 scripts
- 19 working achievements with persistent tracking
- Real-time weather integration
- Interactive DOS-style terminal
- A website (basementos.com) that Claude built from my terminal code

We're about to hit 1k visitors in 5 months. The original world took 3 years for that.

## The unlock

I didn't become a programmer. I became a systems architect. Claude handles implementation. I focus on vision.

## Where it's going

The question keeps evolving. First it was "What can I build?" Then "What should I build?" Now I'm experimenting with Claude as project manager—pre-scoring 58 issues by agentic feasibility so I know what it can handle autonomously while I tackle the creative work.

Would love constructive feedback—what works, what doesn't. Happy to answer questions about the methodology.
