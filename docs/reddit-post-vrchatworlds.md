**Title:** [PC/Quest] Lower Level 2.0 - A 2000s basement hangout with Xbox 360-style achievements, real weather, and a working DOS terminal. Looking for testers!

---

Hey everyone! I've been working on this world for about 4 months and wanted to share it + get some feedback.

## What is it?

Lower Level 2.0 is a detailed recreation of my basement growing up—shag carpet, wood paneling, CRT TVs, the whole vibe. It's designed as a chill hangout spot that actually feels like being back in 2005.

## Features

🎮 **Xbox 360-style achievements** - 19 achievements (420G total) that pop up exactly like the old days. Visit milestones, time spent, and special challenges like "Night Owl" for visiting at 2am.

🌧️ **Real-time weather** - The world pulls actual weather data and displays it on the terminal. Rain sounds when it's raining IRL.

💻 **Interactive DOS terminal** - A working retro terminal with stats, weather, and more. Not just a prop—it actually does stuff.

📺 **ProTV integration** - YouTube, Twitch, whatever you want to watch with friends.

🏆 **Persistent progress** - Your visits, achievements, and stats save between sessions using PlayerData.

## What I'm looking for

This is still proof-of-concept territory. Some things work great, some things are janky. I'd love:
- General vibe check - does it feel nostalgic?
- Bug reports - especially on Quest (I primarily test on PC)
- Feature ideas - what would make it feel more "alive"?
