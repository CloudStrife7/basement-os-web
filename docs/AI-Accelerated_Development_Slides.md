## Slide 2: GOLDEN AGE OF GAMING

### Content
- The goal: Recreate the
- nostalgic
- feel of the original Xbox 360
- Notification system in
- VR.
- November 2005 aesthetics meets modern Virtual Reality.
- THE INSPIRATION

### Speaker Notes
The Inspiration: The Original Xbox 360 Blades Dashboard Experience released alongside the console in November 2005.  Mountain Dew, Xbox halo, system link and plan parties.Some might say it was the  Golden age of Gaming. The Goal:   recreate feelings of the &quot;Golden age of Gaming&quot; inside VRChat. But this wasn't just theory. Let me show you exactly how this played out over 4 weeks...

## Slide 3: Slide 3

### Speaker Notes
This is the Lower Level - a recreation of my basement growing up - I’d say 90% accurate with a little creative liberty ;) To be clear—I didn't use AI to build the walls or the 3D furniture; I commissioned the 3D model base providing detailed plans to recreate the basement I hung out in in college. I worked with AI to install a sort of smart home system, and make the basement 'alive'. The physical 3D space was a commissioned asset was a great canvas. What I built in with AI was the logic—the interactive terminal, the networking, and the systems that actually create a living, breathing place.

## Slide 4: &quot;It's like being asked to paint a masterpiece with a toothbrush using only 3 colors.&quot;

### Content
- The Constraints of UdonSharp Coding

### Speaker Notes
Main Obstacle: I don't know UdonSharp coding. It's a special language just for VRChat. Key Limitations: No complex data structures, no easy error handling, no file access. It's like a sealed box. You can create amazing things, but you need creativity and patience to work within tight constraints. Say this: &quot;To the AI engineers in the room: You know that clean Python environments are a luxury. I deliberately chose UdonSharp—a subset of C# with no generic lists, strict CPU limits, and no real debugging—to simulate a legacy enterprise environment. If I can make agents write functional code  here , I can make them write code anywhere.&quot;

## Slide 5: AI PARTNER

### Content
- Learn &amp; Build simultaneously. Full control. Unlimited scope.
- MY OPTIONS
- HIRE DEV
- High cost. No system understanding. Black box.
- TRADITIONAL
- Trial &amp; Error. 6+ Months to learn. Limited scope.

### Speaker Notes
I had three paths: Traditional Learning: Trial &amp; error. Result: Simple visit counter. Hire a Developer: High cost, no control. Result: Completed system, but no learning. AI Partnership: Learn &amp; build simultaneously. Result: Comprehensive Achievement System. Different paths, different outcomes.

## Slide 7: WORKFLOW_V

### Content
- &quot;
- Don’t tell AI it’s a 30 year expert of Unity when the software hasn’t existed that long.
- &quot;
- Level 1 - AI Assisted Development
- Week 1

### Speaker Notes
Week 1 -  Web-based chat (Standard Interface). Copy-paste workflows into Unity. No version control; reliant on chat history. Hit the &quot;Complexity Wall&quot; at ~500 lines of code. Speaker Notes:  &quot;This is where I started, and honestly, where most organizations stop. I call this  Level 1 . I was using the standard web interface. I’d write a prompt, get code, manually copy it into Unity, and pray it compiled. It works for small scripts. But for a system this complex, it was a trap. I was spending 80% of my time re-explaining the project context to the AI and only 20% building. I realized I wasn't limited by the AI's intelligence; I was limited by my workflow. To build what I wanted, I had to stop acting like a coder and start thinking like a systems architect.&quot; What Didn't Work: Over-Ambitious Complexity. One of my first experiments of prompts was to tell AI it’s a 30 year expert of Unity when the software hasn’t existed that long.  I wondered why it kept making mistakes and it told me “I’m sorry I was overconfident due to your prompt!” One master document became outdated quickly.  (Master KB document generated, used lots of tokens, then is outdated as soon as I add a new feature!) Session complexity exceeded manageable scope. (Trying to do too many things in one session) Hitting chat limits frequently before completing tasks.  (Chat Limits were a huge burden.  Managing chat length did ensure I took breaks lol) Say this: &quot;My first attempt failed because I treated the AI like a chatbot. It hallucinated libraries that didn't exist because I overloaded the context window. I learned the hard way: Prompt Engineering isn't about flattery; it's about context management and modularity.&quot;

## Slide 11: The system was intentionally broken into 8 distinct components to bypass context window limits and manage complexity.

### Content
- Workflow Level 2 - SYSTEMATIC ENGINEERING
- Weeks 2-4
- DEV_CYCLE_V
- .0

### Speaker Notes
Speaker Notes:  &quot;To break through the initial complexity wall, I moved to  Level 2: Systematic Engineering.  I stopped treating the AI like a chatbot and started treating it like a junior developer that needs good specs.   Here’s what I  learned  and  pivoted  to  implement :   implemented 'Context Caching'—creating a living 'Project Knowledge' file. Before I ask for a single line of code, the AI ingests the current state of the architecture. Crucially, I enforced a rule: the AI updates its own documentation. After every session, it rewrites the technical specs. This means I never have to 'remember' the state of the code—the system remembers for me. This allowed me to move from 500 lines of spaghetti code to a structured 2,000-line enterprise architecture.&quot; Context Caching:  Replaced re-explaining the project with  Project Knowledge Files  fed to the AI pre-session. Context Caching: Don't let the AI guess; provide the current state or have it find it. Living Documentation:  The AI updates its own technical specs at the end of every sprint. Context Window : Simple definition:  The amount of information the AI can &quot;remember&quot; at one time. Your story:  &quot;I hit the context window limit in Week 1, so I had to break the OS into 8 small modules so the AI wouldn't forget what it was doing.&quot; Modular Architecture:  The system was intentionally broken into  8 distinct components  to bypass context window limits and manage complexity. Result:  Development velocity increased  3x  and enabled systematic development over ad-hoc coding. --- Merge with above Week 2 - Refinement: Session-focused approach with specific goals.  At the beginning of each session, ask what our focus is.  Custom Project Prompt = Guided Focused sessions.  Session-Focused Prompt: Clear goal for each chat. Living documentation that adapts: Put logs in project knowledge instead of prompt window to save tokens.  Living Docs: Create a new &quot;Project Knowledge&quot; file after every session, or update existing one.

### Content
- Workflow Level 3:  AI-Native Orchestration.

### Speaker Notes
Speaker Notes:  &quot;This is where the project became a professional showcase. This is  Level 3: AI-Native Orchestration.  I am no longer just 'writing code.' I am directing a multi-agent team. I integrated  Unity Model Context Protocol (MCP) , allowing the AI to reach directly into my engine to read logs and validate its own work—it stopped generating code in a vacuum. But here is the result that matters most to this team:  I used AI to implement an entire professional development pipeline I couldn't have built before.  I automated deployment and implemented sophisticated project management by having the AI structure my 51 open issues, estimate complexity, and plan sprints. This is not just 'using AI'—it is the integration of AI into every phase of the professional development lifecycle.&quot;

### Speaker Notes
Slide Bullets: Multi-Agent Swarms:  Running 3+ parallel sessions for specialized roles (Architecture, QA, Implementation). Unity MCP Integration:  AI is now part of the development environment: it reads logs and validates compilation status. Professional DevOps: Automation Pipeline:  Python scripts handle cross-platform (PCVR &lt;-&gt; Quest) script syncing and deployment. Project Management:  AI organized  51 GitHub issues  into epics, assigned story points, and planned 5 sprints. The Unlock:  Scope is now unlimited. I built an entire software development lifecycle, not just a system. Say this: &quot;This is where the shift happened. I stopped writing code and started designing systems. I built a hub-and-spoke architecture (Basement OS) where distinct agents own specific modules—one for Weather API, one for UI, one for Data Persistence. This 'Parallel Swarm' approach let me bypass the context limits that usually kill complex AI projects.&quot; Say this: &quot;This is the most transferable piece for our team. I implemented 'Unity MCP'—effectively a Model Context Protocol that gives the AI 'hands.' It doesn't just write the script; it triggers the compiler, reads the console logs, sees the error, fixes it, and recompiles.  This is a Closed-Loop System.  We can apply this exact loop to our internal devops and testing pipelines immediately.&quot;

## Slide 28: From Generative AI to Agentic AI

### Content
- The Paradigm Shift

### Speaker Notes
Closed-Loop System: Simple definition:  A process that fixes itself (Code -&gt; Error -&gt; Fix -&gt; Success) without a human. Your story:  &quot;My goal was a closed loop. I want to sleep while the AI fixes the bugs.&quot; Morning - The Assembly Line: Launched my first agent swarm with custom agent.md persona files. Nine specialized agents building different Basement OS modules simultaneously - DT_Core, DT_Shell, DT_Theme, weather app, GitHub app, each with injected expertise. This is horizontal scaling - volume without sacrificing architecture. The Gap : Agents could write perfect code, but Unity wouldn't compile it. Files sat on disk, ignored. I was still manually clicking &quot;Compile&quot; in the Inspector. The automation loop was broken. Afternoon - The Missing Link:  I lead AI to generate UdonSharpAssetRepair.cs - the linchpin I'd been missing. This utility script forces Unity to acknowledge programmatically-written files, generates the .asset files, and triggers compilation. It's the bridge between &quot;AI writes code&quot; and &quot;Unity actually runs it.&quot; I created a Automated_Agent_Workflow.md and added it to my CLAUDE.MD —--- Closed-Loop System:  (Code -&gt; Error -&gt; Fix -&gt; Success) without a human. Unity MCP &gt; could write code but not enable udon sharp compile function write unity editor script to bridge gap. MCP Can now create and  implement scripts  but can’t wire them to components Unity Editor Script to bridge the gap &gt;  It reads the logs and if they’re attached and checks logs for compile errors, if there are not, it continues, if there are - it updates the script. .
